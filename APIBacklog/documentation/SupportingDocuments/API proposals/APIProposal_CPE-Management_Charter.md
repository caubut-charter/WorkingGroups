| API family summary | Service enabling API for customer premises equipment (CPE) management. The APIs initial focus is on managing Isolated Networks (API clients can manage the access details for logically separated networks on the same device) and device reboot requests. |
|| An isolated network is a network access configuration where each configuration is for a logically separated Local Area Network (LAN). Application developers can create, modify, or remove these networks which could be useful in scenarios such as: <br><br><li>A property owner wants to create a temporary network for the duration of a short-term booking or long-term rental. </li><li>A property manager wants to replicate the network access details across multiple devices at one or more locations such as common areas, offices, etc. </li><li>A security/privacy-minded user wants to create one or more networks for their guests or Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network clients. </li>|
|| A reboot request is simply a request to reboot a network operator supplied network access device. Application developers can create these requests which could be useful in scenarios such as: <br><br><li>A property owner wants to recover from a faulty network state by rebooting gateway device. </li><li>A property manager wants to reboot multiple devices at one or more locations such as common areas, offices, etc. </li> |
| Technical viability |This API is intended for creating, modifying, or deleting isolated networks using the `/isolated-networks` endpoints to build access detail configurations. The `/service-sites` endpoints are used for iterating over a service owner's locations. The exact location may be requested with an additional scope to assist with reconciling information about service sites when the API client operator has an existing relationship with the service owner. Similarly, the `/devices` endpoints are used for iterating over and configuring a service owner's devices. The `/reboot-requests` endpoints are used for rebooting a service ownerâ€™s network access device.  |
| Commercial viability | This API provides additional functionality to value added resellers and short-term rental agencies who may service one or many properties. Such functionality is suitable for management of the home router and its corresponding network(s). |
